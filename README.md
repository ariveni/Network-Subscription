# Network-Subscription
I developed a network subscription project
aimed at providing users with personalized
plan suggestions based on their past usage.
By visualizing their usage data in histograms,
users can easily understand their data con
sumption patterns. The system calculates the
average usage and recommends the most suit
able plan accordingly
